# Cherish: Time Zone Bridge for Friends

## Project Description

"Cherish" is an innovative tool aimed at international students who face the challenge of staying connected with friends and classmates across different countries and time zones. It offers a virtual meeting space for friends to study together, coupled with an automatic recording feature that captures key moments and screen snapshots when live participation isn't possible due to time differences. These moments are then uploaded to the cloud, allowing any member of the group to access them later. "Cherish" is designed to mitigate the isolating effects of time zone differences, fostering a sense of closeness and engagement within the international student community.

## Key Features

- **Virtual Meeting Room**: An online space for friends to collaborate and study together.
- **Automatic Recording**: Captures and records important moments and screen snapshots for participants who can't join in real-time.
- **Cloud Storage**: Securely stores all recorded data in the cloud for easy and convenient access.
- **Time Zone Accommodation**: Ensures that the platform is friendly and accessible for users across various time zones.

## Objective

The main objective of "Cherish" is to enhance the study experience of international students by bridging the gap created by different time zones. It aims to maintain academic collaboration, nurture friendships, and cherish the moments spent together, even when physically apart.
